 * An {@link Auth} holding an Identity token.

 * Identity tokens are obtained after validating your {@link Credentials}

 * token transparently if you just provide {@link Credentials}.
 * <p>
 * {@link IdentityToken} is useful for cases when you have already obtained
 * a token from a previous session and you wish to reuse it.
